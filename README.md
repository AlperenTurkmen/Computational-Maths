# ECM1416-Coursework
This coursework was made by me, Alperen Turkmen.

About the exercise 1:
We should first find the coordinates of specified paths,
and then multiply each point with matrix A to find how 
they're going to be settled after the transformation.

About the exercise 2:
We should first find the integral of the given equation.
Then we should try to approach it with a method called "Euler's method".
**Leonhard Euler is a Swiss mathematician, one of the greatest of 18th century.**
I described how this method works in the program.
Smaller the step size gets, closer the approximation is made: accuracy is increased and the error is decreased.
I didn't add the error table because it would be confusing but it could've been be good to add it.
